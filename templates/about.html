                <h2>What is Twarble?</h2>
                <hp>Twarble is an application that takes tweets and chat messages and replaces every word in them with their most-smart-sounding synonyms for increased comedic value.</p>
                <h2>How does it work?</h2>
                Twarble uses the tweepy library to obtain tweets from Twitter. Every word is then converted to a synonym with the Datamuse API. After conversion, the tweets are sent to a Flask server which provides you with all the garbled tweets you want.
